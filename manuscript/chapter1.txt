## Daily ride counts

A useful way to tabulate and visualize cab rides is by looking at the number of rides according to the calendar day. In this exercise, you'll compute this summary and examine how daily ridership varies by time and the day of week.

- Create a daily summary, grouping by the date of pickup (pickup_date) and counting the number of rides, calling the new variable n_rides.

- Plot the result using ggplot2's geom_line(), with pickup_date on the x-axis and n_rides on the y-axis.
